                        <h2>What is Co-Make?</h2>
                        <p>Co-Make is a hub created for local community members in order to identify and prioritize 
                            problems in their area. The process is simple: you identify a problem, your community 
                            upvotes that issue if they find it important, and your local government or HOA solves it.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>

                <p>It's never been easier to get involved in your community. Co-make sorts issues by zip code, allowing 
                   users to quickly find their area and get involved in seconds, whether to support an existing issue 
                   or add your own.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>With Co-makes's upvote system, the process to rank and begin problem-solving is fully democratic.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>Users can show appreciation to active community members by offering rewards, encouraging 
                   community engagement.</p>

                <br><br>

                <p>Co-make brings communities together around the common goal of creating better communities 
                   and making problem solving easier than ever before.</p>
